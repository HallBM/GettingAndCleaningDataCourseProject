## GettingAndCleaningDataCourseProject

## A Peer-graded Assignment for the "Getting and Cleaning Data" Course Project on Coursera

## BACKGROUND 
# One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. In this project, data obtained from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone were extracted, cleaned and analyzed. 

# A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones  

# The compressed data analyzed in this project can be found here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip  

## Files 
# README.md : Description of project and file information.
# CodeBook.md : Description of code, including variables, data manipulations, and final output table.
# run_analysis.R : Provides script for extracting, compiling, processing and analyzing the data. The R script performs the following:
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# Tidy Table_Mean for Subject and Action : Final output tidy table displaying the average value for a defined set of parameters for all actions for each subject. More detailed description in CodeBook.md
